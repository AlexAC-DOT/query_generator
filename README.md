# Database Reconciliation Tool

## Overview

The Database Reconciliation Tool is a Python project designed to generate SQL queries that ensure two databases have the same tables and data. This tool helps in identifying discrepancies between two databases and generates the necessary SQL statements to reconcile them.

## Features

- **SQL Query Generation**: Generate SQL queries to reconcile differences in table structures and data.
- **Report Generation**: Produce a report detailing the differences and the generated SQL queries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/db-reconciliation-tool.git
   cd db-reconciliation-tool
   ```

2. Install Poetry:
   ```sh
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the reconciliation process:
```sh
poetry run python main.py
```

The tool will:
1. Compare the table structures of the source and target databases.
2. Compare the data within each table.
3. Generate SQL queries to reconcile any differences.
4. Output a report summarizing the differences and the generated SQL queries.
